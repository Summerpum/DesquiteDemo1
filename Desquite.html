<p> <h5 style="color:red;text-alignment:center;">Hello, Bruhv. This website is being made for a feeble web comic, welcome to hell.</p>

<p> We have an estranged 8 year old boy back in 1975. His father is shellshocked from the vietnam war subsequently
	decides to do heroin as a method of escapism from the tretchery he faced. But it bleeds over to his family the
	more time that passes.</p>
